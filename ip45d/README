The ip45 userspace host implementation



===========================================================================
Building and Installation
===========================================================================

For Unix-Like systems (Linux, OSX):

# make 

Creates ip45d executable that can be run with root privileges



# make install 

To install binary into system 



# rpmbuild -ba ip45d.spec

To build rpm packages 



For Windows system (cross build on Unix):

# make win 

Build binnary package and creates ip45d.exe ip45serv.exe and ip45setup.exe



For Windows system (on Windows with mingw installed) 

# make.bat

Builds ip45d.exe and ip45serv.exe 



===========================================================================
Structure of Files 
===========================================================================

The code is divided into several files: 

ip45d.c             - Entry rutine, help scrren (cals functions in 
                      ip45d_common.c, ip45d_posix.c, ip45d_win.c)
ip45d.h             - Platform dependend includes 

ip45d_common.c      - Code shared by all platforms (conversion if IPv6 packet 
                      to IP45packet and back)
                      
ip45d_posix.c       - Code related to posix platforms (Linux, OSX), implemented 
                      as single therad application. For OSX it usees platform 
                      specific code to use utun device. 

ip45d_win.c         - Code related to Windows platform, implemented as two 
                      thread application using non blocking system operations. 

session_table.c     - Implementation of session table. Implemented as 
                      the simple linked list. 

inet_ntop45.c       - Conversion to humman readable IP45 address and back. 

ip45serv.c          - System service fo Windows (internally calls ip45d.exe). Use 
                      ip45serv.exe to get more help.

compat_win.c        - Implementation inet_pton and inet_ntop function for Windows 
                      platform. 

ip45d-init-d        - The starting script for Linux. The file shoul be copied to 
                      /etc/init.d/ip45d.

ip45d.spec          - Specfile for creating rpm package. The rpm package can be 
                      installed later into Linux-based systems.
 
ip45.nsi            - Installer script for NSIS. Creates installabe package 
                      ip45seup.exe that can be used for installation of ip45 on 
                      Windows platforms. 

*.h                 - The header files that are not shipped by default on all platforms.
