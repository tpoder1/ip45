The ip45 user space host implementation

The source is available in the form of [package](http://ip45.org/packages/source/ip45d/) or in the SVN 
[repository](http://code.google.com/p/ip45/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fip45d).

Running the program
-------------------
* On the command line execute the ip45d: 

		# ./ip45d -v 

It sets up virtual tun/tup interface and configure the address on it. On the 
windows platform ip45d.exe must be used instead. 

		# ip45d.exe -v 

On the windows platform IPv6 address ::1:0:0/8 must be configured 
on the tap interface.


Building and Installation
-------------------------

* For Unix-Like systems (Linux, OSX):

		# make

  Creates ip45d executable that can be run on system with root privileges. 

* To install binary into system use:

		# make install 

* To build rpm packages:

		# rpmbuild -ba ip45d.spec

* For Windows system (cross build on Unix):

		# make win 

  Builds binary package and creates ip45d.exe ip45serv.exe and ip45setup.exe


* For Windows system (on Windows with mingw installed): 

		# make.bat

  Builds ip45d.exe and ip45serv.exe 




Structure of Files 
------------------

The code is divided into several files: 

* ip45d.c           - Entry routine, help screen (calls functions in 
                      ip45d_common.c, ip45d_posix.c, ip45d_win.c).

* ip45d.h           - Platform depended includes.

* ip45d_common.c    - Code shared by all platforms (conversion if IPv6 packet 
                      to Ip45 packet and back)
                      
* ip45d_posix.c     - Code related to posix platforms (Linux, OSX), implemented 
                      as single thread application. For OSX it users platform 
                      specific code to use utun device. 

* ip45d_win.c       - Code related to Windows platform, implemented as two 
                      thread application using non blocking system operations. 

* session_table.c   - Implementation of session table. Implemented as 
                      the simple linked list. 

* inet_ntop45.c     - Conversion to human readable IP45 address and back. 

* ip45serv.c        - System service fog Windows (internally calls ip45d.exe). Use 
                      ip45serv.exe to get more help.

* compat_win.c      - Implementation inet_pton and inet_ntop function for Windows 
                      platform. 

* ip45d-init-d      - The starting script for Linux. The file should be copied to 
                      /etc/init.d/ip45d.

* ip45d.spec        - Specfile for creating rpm package. The rpm package can be 
                      installed later into Linux-based systems.
 
* ip45.nsi          - Installer script for NSIS. Creates installation package 
                      ip45seup.exe that can be used for installation of ip45 on 
                      Windows platforms. 

* *.h               - The header files that are not shipped by default on all platforms.
