ip45 patch for glibc 
=======================================

The patch updates functions inet_pton and inet_ntop to 
support IP45. The function inet_pton accepts addres 
in the following format for address type AF_INET6:

147.229.240.249.3.15 -> converts to binary format 

The function inet_ntop tries to perform reverse function. 
There applied following rules that keeps formating 
of the adress in the original IPv6 notation. The 
address that is formated to IP45 notation have to 
fulfill follwing rules: 

1. The first 8 bytes are set to 0 
2. Last 4 octets are not set to 0 
3. Octests 1-10 are set to 0 and octest 12,13 are set to 0xFF (IPv4 mapped address)


Applying patch to the source glibc code
========================================
1. Get glibc source from http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/ (eg. glibc-2.15.tar.gz)
2. Unpack source 
  
  # tar xzf glibc-2.15.tar.gz

3. Apply the patch 

  # cd glibc-2.15
  # patch -p1 < ../glibc-ip45-resolv.patch 
  patching file resolv/inet_ntop.c
  patching file resolv/inet_pton.c

4. Follow instructions to recompile and install glibc source 


Applying patch to source RPM 
========================================
1. Get glibc .src.rpm for your distribution (eg. glibc-2.12-1.80.el6_3.6.src.rpm)
2. Install .src.rpm file 

  # rpm -ihvv glibc-2.12-1.80.el6_3.6.src.rpm 

3. Copy patch to rpm SOURCES directory 

  # cp glibc-ip45-resolv.patch /root/rpmbuild/SOURCES
  
4. Open glibc.spec file 

  # vim  /root/rpmbuild/SPECS/glibc.spec 

5. Find end of the Patch section in the specfile and add following line 

  Patch106: glibc-ip45-resolv.patch 

  and following line in %prep section !!

  %patch106 -p1 

  // The number of the patch have to follow the patch numbering used in the file 
  // You can also update Release: macro to distinguish the package from the 
  // original glibc source.rpm. The release might loog following 

  Release: 1.80%{?dist}.6ip45

6.  Switch to /root/rpmbuild/SPECS dir and rebuild a new rpms (src and binary) for glibc

  # cd /root/rpmbuild/SPECS
  # rpmbuild -ba glibc.spec

7. Install new rpm into your system 

  # cd /root/rpmbuild/RPMS
  # cd x86_64 
  # yum update glibc* 

8. Reboot system 


How the patch was created ? 
========================================
The patch was created using following commnd:

diff -rupN glibc-2.12-2-gc4ccff1.orig/resolv \
           glibc-2.12-2-gc4ccff1/resolv > glibc-ip45-resolv.patch
